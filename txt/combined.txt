BISON: BISulfite alignment On Nodes of a cluster
================================================

Welcome to the Bison tutorial. In this short tutorial I hope to walk you through how to successfully install and use the various programs in the Bison package. This tutorial comes with 3 example datasets, two simulated E.Coli whole-genome bisulfite sequencing datasets generated with http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/sherman/[Sherman] and a small human targeted bisulfite sequencing data generously provided by Meeshanthini Dogan in Prof. Robert Philibert's lab at the University of Iowa.
